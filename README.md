# Splitter - Tip Calculator

## Hi, I'm Ivan! ðŸ‘‹

And this is a simple tip calculator app built using React. It allows you to calculate the tip and total amount of a bill based on the bill amount, the number of people splitting the bill, and the percentage of the tip. You can also input a custom tip percentage, and reset the form to its initial state.

Try it out! [DEMO](https://ivxvi.github.io/tip-calculator-splitter/)

HTML/CSS (SASS)

## Lessons Learned

State management: I`ve learned how to use the useState hook to manage the state of the app, such as the bill amount, the number of people, and the tip percentage.

Event handling: I`ve learned how to handle user input and other events using React's event handling system, such as handling changes to the bill amount or the number of people, or clicking on a button to select a tip percentage.

Props and types: I`ve learned how to use props to pass data and functions between components, and how to define types for props using TypeScript.
